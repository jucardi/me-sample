# Sample microservice for go-titan
This repository contains a code sample to build a microservice using the go-titan framework. It can be used to build both REST JSON APIs and gRPC services using Protobuf.

## Requirements

 - Docker and docker-compose
 - Make
 - Golang

## Running the sample microservice

Use the following command to run the project.

    $ make run

Everything should run on Docker, so that's the only dependency needed.
You can also run

    $ make protoc

In order to generate the model files from the .proto files.

## Project structure

 - **api**: This folder contains subfolders with subjects of the API. Each subfolder may contain one or more .proto file with the [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) message description which, when compiled, will generate the structs that will work as DTOs to communicate with the client applications. Each subfolder also contains a spec file, which contains the routes and the interface for the API controller.
 - **cmd**: This folder contains the entrypoint for the application. Most of the times, it won't be necessary to make any modification on it.
 - **fixtures**: This folder contains the config files for the application. All config values can be defined on the config.yaml file, under the service topic. All values there can be accessed through the ServiceConfig described bellow.
 - **server**:
	 - **api**: Contains the subfolders related to the API structure. Most of the times only the controller.go and routes.go files will need to be modified. The Controller must match the interface described in the spec file in the api folder described above. The Routes file contains the link between the API route/method and the Controller method responsible to handle it.
	 - **config**: Contains the ServiceConfig description. It is a struct that should match the data inserted in the config.yaml file. It is important to put the correct tags in each field that match the key used in the YAML or JSON file, so the framework can parse it correctly. Most of the time only the config.go file will need to be modified.
	 - **repository**: Contains the definition of the repositories of the service. Each subfolder may contain the definition of a topic of the microservice. The dbe.go file contains the definition of the struct which represents the  Database Entity for the subject. The types.go file contains the interface of for the repository.go file, which contains the implementation of the repository. All database related logic must be defined here. Usually only the dbe.go, types.go and repository.go files will need to be modified.
	 - **service**: Contains all the services related to the microservice. Usually, each service will be located under their subfolder. Each service definition contains the types.go file, which defines the interface for the service and the service.go file, which contains the implementation. There is also the mapper.go file, which contains some logic to convert a DTO into a DBE and vice-versa. Usually only these 3 files will have to be modified.
 - **vendor**: Contains the dependencies of the project. Different from other languages, in Golang it is useful to save your dependencies with the project on Git, as if any dependency is deleted from Github, you still have a copy of it to keep your project working.
